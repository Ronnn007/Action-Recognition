# Action-Recognition
## 3D CNN action Recognition using pytorch lightning and Pytorch Video API on UCF101 dataset!
### In this Repo
* I utilize Pytorch Lightning library to showcase quick deep learning framework for Video analysis
* As well as showcase Pytorch Video API and its usefull functionality to automate video pre-processing and dataset managing steps
* Finally several models and their training outcomes are compared and analysed

## Data Exploration 
* Firstly here is how the dataset splits are accross all of the different exprimentations

* Secondly here are some of the examples of the frames used for training. 3 classes are selected:
  * Soccer Penalty ![](https://github.com/Ronnn007/Action-Recognition/blob/main/Graph/penalty%20frames.jpg)
  * Bowling ![](https://github.com/Ronnn007/Action-Recognition/blob/main/Graph/Bowling%20frames.jpg)
  * Playing Flute ![](https://github.com/Ronnn007/Action-Recognition/blob/main/Graph/Flute%20frames.jpg)

## 3D Convolution Operations
* The 3d convolution operation further explored:
